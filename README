CSV NOTIFIER

This script is meant to be called from a Git hook such as post-receive.
It will identify all the files with a .csv extension which have been modified in any given pushed commit, it will compress them into a zip archive and it will send them by email to the specified recipients.

USAGE
=====
Call the script from the post-receive file in the "hooks" directory of the remote Git repository.

    #!/bin/sh
    /path/to/csv_notifier.rb /path/to/csv_config.yml

The script has a single required parameter, which is a YML configuration file. See csv_config.yml.sample for an example.
